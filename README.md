# Youtube Downloader Flask
  
  
  ## Description 
  
  
  This is a downloader for YouTube videos, made using Flask. It features a good, simplistic UI. It works by first downloading the file using PyTube library to the working directory and sending it to the user using the send_file functionality in Flask. It also operates a thread to delete the videos every half an hour. It is just a beginner project and my first ever open-source GitHub Project.
